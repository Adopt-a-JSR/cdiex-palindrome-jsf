CDI example application

CDI + JSF palindrome application. It is packaged as a war archive and demonstrates quite a few features of CDI 1.x (JSR 299 and JSR 346). 

It depends on cdiex-datastore.

To deploy in JBoss 7.1.1, this needs to be patched with the CDI 1.1 RI first using the installer for Weld 2.0.0.Beta7 which can be found at: https://github.com/weld/as7-weld-subsystem/tree/2.0.0.Beta7.
Then you can deploy via: mvn jboss-as:deploy
